###4.4 RTC Test  

This example demonstrates how to use Linux API to read and write real time on RTCï¼Œplease refer to the source code for detail. 
Users can also test the RTC with `date` and `hwclock` command built with Buildroot.  

**Hardware Preparation:**  
  * One MYD-C437X-PRU development board     
  * One USB to TTL converter used to connect J25 of MYD-C437X-PRU development board and host PC, set the baudrate of serial port on  host PC to 115200-8-n-1
  * One CR2032 button cell  
	
**Software Preparation: **  
  * Linux Kernel 4.1.18   
  * date, hwclock command 
  * rtc_test application    
 
**Test Steps: **  
  * Copy cross compiled `<WORKDIR>/Examples/rtc/rtc_test` to `/usr/bin` directory of the MYD-C437X-PRU development board, run `rtc_test` application as below:

```
# chmod 777 /usr/bin/rtc_test
# rtc_test -h 
Usage: rtc_test [options]

Version 1.0
Options:
-d | --device name   rtc device name, default: /dev/rtc0
-w | --write  time	 time string with format MMDDhhmm[CCYY][.ss]. such as: 111817582016.18 
-h | --help          Print this message

# rtc_test -d /dev/rtc1 -w 111817582016.18

  date/time is updated to:  18-11-2016, 17:58:18.
```  
  
  * Power off the MYD-C437X-PRU development board, wait for a while, power on again and read the rtc time by `rtc_test` as below:

```
# rtc_test -d /dev/rtc1

  Current RTC date/time is 18-11-2016, 17:59:12.
```
  * Users can also use date and hwclock command to test RTC as below:  

```
# date  081518002016.30							-- Set system time to 2016/8/15 18:00:30
Mon Aug 15 18:00:30 UTC 2016
# date
Mon Aug 15 18:00:38 UTC 2016
# hwclock -w /dev/rtc1							-- Write system time to rtc1
```  
  * Power off the MYD-C437X-PRU development board, wait for a while, power on again and read the rtc time by hwclock as below:  

```
# hwclock -r /dev/rtc1							-- 
Mon Aug 15 18:11:08 2016  0.000000 seconds

```
